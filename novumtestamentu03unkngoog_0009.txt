PREFACE.

Tria now aehnowledged propriety of giving studente ri
isrrguages familiar worls for translation-thus adopting in the
schools the mode by which the. child first learns to talk-has
induced the publication of this new American Edition of Theo
tiore de Bezo’s Latin Version of the New Testament Scriptores.

Of the work itself it is hardly necessary tc speak. lte publi-
cation was suggested by the favor with which the authnr's lectores
on the Epistles were received at the Academy of lausanae.
The translation thus heralded was received witha favor which
with Protcstanl Christiane it has never lost Several editions
were puhlished during the lifetirne of Bere, to which he made
such improvements as his attention was directed to, or as were
prompted by his familiarity‚ as Greek Professor, with the origi·
nal. Since 1556, when ir first appeared at Genava, this work
has kept its place in the general esteem; while ruore recent
versione have been so strongly tinged with the peculiarities cf
the translatore as to make thern acceptable to particular classes
only. The Editor has exerted himself to 'render the present
edition, by its superior accuracy and aestuosa, worthy of pa·
tronnge3 and the Publishers flatter themselves that the paine ,
bestowed will insure for it a preference over any other edition.
